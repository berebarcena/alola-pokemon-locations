# Alola Pokemon Locations

I recently bought Pokemon Ultra Sun, and one of the things I like doing when I play any Pokemon titles is actually catch them all from the very begginning. This means, it's important for me to know which pokemon appear on which locations, at what time of the day, area and rate. With Pokemon Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Moon, it's also important to know which Pokemon only appear as SOS Pokemon and to which.

Despite all this information being out there in Bulbapedia and Smogo, I found it extremely difficult to consume. Not only was the information in a page surrounded by other information that wasn't necessarily relevant to my goal, but moving to a new region in the game meant having to search for a new wiki page and find the information. On top of that, the game's information is displayed in the same wiki page for both the original and ultra version, meaning that after finding the information I had to make sure it was that for the game I'm actually playing.

NO MORE!

This project takes care of going to all the manually sourced relevant sources in Bulbapedia and crawl all the information on Pokemon location around the Alola region. It also categorizes it per game from the begginning, making it easy to navigate the information in a linear and easy to consume way as you play the games.

Since the markup rendered is directly crawled from Bulbapedia, there is only so much that can be done for styling. For this reason, the CSS of the project is a CSS hell full of important rules. Please report any visual bugs (specially in the mobile version).

As a final note, if any discrepancies are found compared to the data found in Bulbapedia, file an issuee as well. Chances are the information in Bulbapedia was update and needs ot be re-crawled. However, it may also be possible that the styling hacks ended up hiding some rows from a particular location table.

Enjoy catching the aall around Alola!
